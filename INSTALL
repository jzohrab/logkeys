 logkeys keylogger - instalation instructions
===============================================================================

Provided your GNU/Linux distribution doesn't include logkeys package
in its repositories, manual installation of logkeys from source is as
easy as cloning this repo or [downloading a zip of the
source](https://github.com/kernc/logkeys/archive/master.zip),
unzipping, and building:

    $ unzip logkeys-master.zip
    $ cd logkeys-master/src
    $ ../configure
    $ make
    $ su               # get root to install in system
    $ make install     # installs binaries, manuals and scripts

To uninstall logkeys, remove accompanying scripts and manuals:

    # make uninstall    # in the same src dir

See README file for usage instructions, troubleshooting and other notes.
